					<p align="justify">
							&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Greetings of peace, success and prosperity! My name is Tristan Railey A. Marasigan, and I'm delighted to 
							have the opportunity to introduce myself to you. I'm 21 years old and currently reside in Barangay Muzon San Luis, Batangas. We are five in 
							the family,together with our seven lovely dogs! My mother is a plain housewife, while my father has a small business with him that provides 
							our source of income. I have a background in the Philippine Air Force as a Reservist, or Laang Kawal ng Pilipinas. My passion for volunteering 
							stems from my experience as a CAT officer when I was in high school at Alitagtag College, Inc. Main. You can easily get along with me since 
							I am a very accessible person. Being loud and jolly is my personality, and I really talk a lot. I am very proud of myself for being a consistent 
							honor student from daycare up tosenior high school, but since college life is way too different, I am eager to accept every single challenge 
							and take every opportunity to develop my skills, nurture my abilities in achieving my goals, and become a globally competitive individual with
							my chosen career path. Thank you for taking the time to get to know me a little better. I am thrilled to take off on this journey with you and 
							see where it goes. </p>
