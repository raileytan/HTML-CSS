                    [Verse 1]
					<br>
					I can think of all the times
					<br>
					You told me not to touch the light
                    <br>
                    I never thought that you would be the one
                    <br>
                    I couldn't really justify
                    <br>
                    How you even thought it could be right
                    <br>
					Cause everything we cherished is gone
                    <br>
					And in the end, can you tell me if
                    <br>
					It was worth the try, so I can decide
					<br>
					<br>
					<br>
					[CHORUS]
					<br>
					Leaves will soon grow from the bareness of trees
                    <br>
                    And all will be alright in time
                    <br>
                    From waves overgrown come the calmest of seas
                    <br>
                    And all will be alright in time
                    <br>
                    Oh you never really love someone until you learn to forgive
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
					[Verse 2]
					<br>
                    Try as hard as I might
                    <br>
                    To flee the shadows of the night
                    <br>
					It haunts me and it makes me feel blue
                    <br>
					But how can I try to hide
                    <br>
                    When every breath and every hour
                    <br>
                    I still end up thinking of you?
                    <br>
                    And in the end, everything we have makes it worth the fight
                    <br>
                    So I will hold on for as long
                    <br>
					<br>
					<br>
					[CHORUS]
					<br>
					Leaves will soon grow from the bareness of trees
                    <br>
                    And all will be alright in time
                    <br>
                    From waves overgrown come the calmest of seas
                    <br>
                    And all will be alright in time
                    <br>
                    Oh you never really love someone until you learn to forgive
                    <br>
                    <br>
					<br>
					[Bridge]
					<br>
					I never thought that I would see the day
                    <br>
                    That I'd decide if I should leave or stay
                    <br>
                    But in the end what makes it worth the fights
                    <br>
                    That no matter what happens we try to make it right
                    <br>
					<br>
                    <br>
					[CHORUS]
					<br>
					Leaves will soon grow from the bareness of trees
                    <br>
                    And all will be alright in time
                    <br>
                    From waves overgrown come the calmest of seas
                    <br>
                    And all will be alright in time
                    <br>
                    Oh you never really love someone until you learn to forgive
					<br>
                    Wounds of the past will eventually heal
                    <br>
                    And all will be alright in time
                    <br>
					'Cause all of this comes with a love that is real
                    <br>
					I said all will be alright in time
                    <br>
                    I said all will be alright in time
                    <br>
                    I said all will be alright in time
                    <br>
					All will be alright in time
                    <br>
					<br>
					<br>
					[Outro]
                    <br>
					Oh, you never really love someone until
                    <br>
                    You learn to forgive
                    <br>
                    You learn to forgive
                    <br>
                    Learn to forgive
                    <br>
